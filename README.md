# My ROS2 Study Record

## Node

I started by creating a node. Through this process, I gained a better understanding of ROS2 by creating a package and running the node directly.

## Service

I created a service in ROS2. I developed a package that utilizes nodes to establish communication between a server and a client.

## With Arduino

I wrote code to control a DC motor and a servo motor through ROS2 by communicating with an Arduino.
